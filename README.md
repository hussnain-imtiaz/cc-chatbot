# POC - Contact Centre Analytics Chatbot

A multi-agent analytics chatbot built over January 2026 contact centre data.
Ask natural language questions, approve the query plan, see the SQL, run it, get a clean answer.

Built as a proof-of-concept  - designed to show agentic AI
principles in practice.

## Quick start

You need Python 3.11+, [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), and an OpenAI API key.

```bash
# 1. clone
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/cc-chatbot.git
cd cc-chatbot

# 2. install uv if you don't have it
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# 3. install dependencies
uv sync

# 4. set your API key
cp .env.example .env
# open .env and set OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# 5. run
uv run streamlit run app.py
```

Open link in browser, ask questions about the contact centre data, see the SQL, get answers.

That's it.

## Running tests

```bash
# all tests - no network, no OpenAI calls
uv run pytest tests/ -v

# just tool tests
uv run pytest tests/test_sql_tools.py -v
```

---

## Running the eval

```bash
# quick - first 5 questions only (cheap, fast)
uv run python eval/runner.py Q01 Q02 Q03 Q04 Q05

# full 30-question eval 
uv run python eval/runner.py
```

The eval scores table selection accuracy and intent classification accuracy.
Passes if both are >= 90%. Results are also visible in the Observability tab.

## Assumptions

- Current date is fixed to **2026-01-31** - the last day of the available data
- "Business hours" means 08:00–17:59
- "Last week" means Jan 25-31, "first half" means Jan 1-15, "second half" means Jan 16-31
- The data dictionary DOCX is loaded at startup - if missing, a hardcoded fallback is used

---

## Known limitations

- Derived metrics (staffing, weighted averages) use ad-hoc SQL rather than canonical formulas.
  A proper Erlang C tool would give more consistent staffing estimates.
- Metric consistency across a session is not enforced - asking about "most calls" twice
  in different ways may use different columns (All Ans vs In Ans).
  Fix can be: store columns_used in ConversationMemory and pass to orchestrator.
- No streaming - responses appear all at once after the full pipeline completes.
- Ollama/local models can be integrated but are not included or tested in this POC. client_factory.py is designed to support them, but might require tweaks to code, prompt formats and guardrails for non-OpenAI models.
